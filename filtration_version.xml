	<ReleaseNotes>Special thanks to GlenCFL for implementing the following features:
♦ Support for the following Filter Block Item Types: ElderItem, ShapedMap, ShaperItem, PlayAlertPositionalSound, 
♦ Added new alert sounds including the shaper voiceline sounds
♦ Updated Item Base Types and Item Classes static data for 3.1
♦ Fixed a bug where the application would freeze upon exit

Other new features:
♦ Changed Block Group Parsing to use " - " as a delimiter instead of "-", this prevents unwanted block groups being created by filters that didn't intend to use them.
♦ Block Groups are now only parsed if the script has "# EnableBlockGroups" on its own line in the script header. This means that comments on the Show/Hide line for scripts without this enabled will no longer be discarded.
♦ All comment blocks in between filter blocks are now preserved regardless of whether they start with # Section:
♦ Added initial undo/redo support - currently this is only supported at the Item Filter Block level. This means that you can undo/redo adding/deleting/moving blocks within a script but you can't undo/redo editing the blocks themselves.
