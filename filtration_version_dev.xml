	<ReleaseNotes>♦ Changed maximum PlayAlertSound volume from 100 to 300 as per latest patch
♦ The update check on startup was broken in 0.10 - this has now been fixed.
♦ Please note that this is the first auto-updated release since 0.9 and includes the async saving and loading changes from 0.10 which was not auto-updated in order to get feedback on stability (given the lack of complaints I'm going to assume everything's all good!).
